What is this?

This is a 3D dice-rolling animation project titled "Canvas_Dice_Animation". I created this project as a learning step while developing a Ludo game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My goal was to design an interactive and visually appealing dice-rolling animation from scratch, using only the HTML <canvas> element without relying on any external 3D libraries.

Why did I create this?
To make the dice rolling in my Ludo game engaging, I wanted a realistic animation that would enhance the overall user experience. While researching, I decided to challenge myself to implement the 3D dice animation entirely with JavaScript and the Canvas API, allowing me to strengthen my understanding of these technologies.

Key Features:
3D Animation: Simulates a dice roll with realistic rotation and perspective.
Custom Implementation: Written entirely from scratch using the Canvas API without external libraries.
Interactive Learning: Serves as a standalone project showcasing the integration of mathematical calculations and visual effects.
How does it fit into the Ludo game?
The dice is a crucial part of any Ludo game, determining player moves. By creating a custom animation, I ensured that the dice rolling looks dynamic and feels interactive. This project is a small but significant component of my larger Ludo game development journey.

Feel free to explore the animation and its source code. Your feedback is always welcome! ðŸ˜Š
